# API Rate Limiting

## Overview

API rate limiting is a critical feature for protecting our service from abuse and ensuring fair usage across all clients.

## Key Requirements

- **Per-user limits**: Each user should have individual rate limits based on their subscription tier
- **Per-endpoint limits**: Different API endpoints may have different rate limit thresholds
- **Sliding window**: Use a sliding window approach rather than fixed time buckets
- **Graceful degradation**: Return meaningful error messages when limits are exceeded

## Implementation Strategy

The rate limiting will be implemented at the gateway level using Redis for fast, distributed rate limit tracking. We'll use a token bucket algorithm with the following parameters:

- Free tier: 100 requests/hour
- Pro tier: 1000 requests/hour  
- Enterprise tier: 10000 requests/hour

## Monitoring and Alerting

We need comprehensive monitoring to track:
- Rate limit violations per user
- Performance impact of rate limiting
- False positive rate limit triggers
