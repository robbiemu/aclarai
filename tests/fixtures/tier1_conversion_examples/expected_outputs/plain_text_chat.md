Dr. Smith: Good morning everyone. Today we're discussing the implementation of evaluation agents for claim quality assessment.

Research Assistant: Morning Dr. Smith. I've been reading about the three-agent system: entailment, coverage, and decontextualization.
<!-- aclarai:id=blk_w1x2y3 ver=1 -->
^blk_w1x2y3

Dr. Smith: Exactly. The entailment agent checks if the claim is logically supported by its source. Scores range from 0 to 1.

Research Assistant: And coverage measures how completely the claim captures verifiable information?
<!-- aclarai:id=blk_c7d8e9 ver=1 -->
^blk_c7d8e9

Dr. Smith: That's right. If key information is omitted, the coverage score drops. Those omitted elements become separate nodes in the graph.

Graduate Student: What happens if an agent fails during evaluation?
<!-- aclarai:id=blk_i3j4k5 ver=1 -->
^blk_i3j4k5

Dr. Smith: Good question! If any agent fails, that score becomes null. Claims with null scores aren't promoted to concept pages or summaries.
<!-- aclarai:id=blk_l6m7n8 ver=1 -->
^blk_l6m7n8

Graduate Student: I see. So the geometric mean of all three scores determines overall quality?
<!-- aclarai:id=blk_o9p0q1 ver=1 -->
^blk_o9p0q1

Dr. Smith: Precisely. The formula is: geomean = (entailed_score × coverage_score × decontextualization_score)^(1/3)
<!-- aclarai:id=blk_r2s3t4 ver=1 -->
^blk_r2s3t4

Research Assistant: And claims below the quality threshold get filtered out but remain in the graph for diagnostics?
<!-- aclarai:id=blk_u5v6w7 ver=1 -->
^blk_u5v6w7

Dr. Smith: Exactly. This prevents low-quality claims from polluting the vault while preserving them for future analysis or reprocessing.
<!-- aclarai:id=blk_x8y9z0 ver=1 -->
^blk_x8y9z0

Graduate Student: The decontextualization score is interesting - it ensures claims can stand alone without their original context.
<!-- aclarai:id=blk_a1b2c3 ver=1 -->
^blk_a1b2c3

Dr. Smith: That's crucial for knowledge reuse. Claims in concept pages need to be understandable independently of their source conversations.
<!-- aclarai:id=blk_d4e5f6 ver=1 -->
^blk_d4e5f6

Research Assistant: The metadata format stores these scores as HTML comments, right? Like <!-- aclarai:entailed_score=0.91 -->
<!-- aclarai:id=blk_g7h8i9 ver=1 -->
^blk_g7h8i9

Dr. Smith: Yes, and that's compatible with Obsidian while remaining human-readable. Very elegant solution.
