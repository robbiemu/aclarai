PARTICIPANTS: tech_lead, junior_dev, product_manager
TOPIC: API Design Review

ENTRY [16:45:00] tech_lead >> Let's review the REST API endpoints for the aclarai services. We need consistency across all microservices.

ENTRY [16:45:32] junior_dev >> I noticed we have different authentication patterns. Some use JWT, others use API keys.

ENTRY [16:46:15] tech_lead >> Good catch. We should standardize on JWT with proper scope-based authorization for all services.

ENTRY [16:46:45] product_manager >> From a product perspective, what's the impact on existing integrations?

ENTRY [16:47:20] tech_lead >> Minimal impact if we version the APIs properly. We can deprecate the old auth methods gradually.

ENTRY [16:48:00] junior_dev >> Should we implement rate limiting consistently too?

ENTRY [16:48:30] tech_lead >> Absolutely. Same rate limits, same headers, same error responses across all endpoints.

ENTRY [16:49:10] product_manager >> That sounds good for developer experience. Consistent APIs are much easier to work with.

ENTRY [16:49:45] junior_dev >> I'll update the OpenAPI specs to reflect these standards.

ENTRY [16:50:15] tech_lead >> Perfect. And let's make sure the error handling follows RFC 7807 for problem details.
