Dr. Smith: Good morning everyone. Today we're discussing the implementation of evaluation agents for claim quality assessment.

Research Assistant: Morning Dr. Smith. I've been reading about the three-agent system: entailment, coverage, and decontextualization.

Dr. Smith: Exactly. The entailment agent checks if the claim is logically supported by its source. Scores range from 0 to 1.

Research Assistant: And coverage measures how completely the claim captures verifiable information?

Dr. Smith: That's right. If key information is omitted, the coverage score drops. Those omitted elements become separate nodes in the graph.

Graduate Student: What happens if an agent fails during evaluation?

Dr. Smith: Good question! If any agent fails, that score becomes null. Claims with null scores aren't promoted to concept pages or summaries.

Graduate Student: I see. So the geometric mean of all three scores determines overall quality?

Dr. Smith: Precisely. The formula is: geomean = (entailed_score × coverage_score × decontextualization_score)^(1/3)

Research Assistant: And claims below the quality threshold get filtered out but remain in the graph for diagnostics?

Dr. Smith: Exactly. This prevents low-quality claims from polluting the vault while preserving them for future analysis or reprocessing.

Graduate Student: The decontextualization score is interesting - it ensures claims can stand alone without their original context.

Dr. Smith: That's crucial for knowledge reuse. Claims in concept pages need to be understandable independently of their source conversations.

Research Assistant: The metadata format stores these scores as HTML comments, right? Like <!-- clarifai:entailed_score=0.91 -->

Dr. Smith: Yes, and that's compatible with Obsidian while remaining human-readable. Very elegant solution.
