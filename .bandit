# Bandit configuration for ClarifAI monorepo
# Configuration to reduce false positives for containerized applications
# Skip specific checks that are false positives for our use case:
# B101: Use of assert detected - Normal in test files
# B104: Hardcoded bind all interfaces - Intentional for containerized web apps
skips = B101,B104

# Exclude test directories to avoid assert-related warnings  
exclude_dirs = tests,*/tests

# Focus on medium and high severity issues
severity = medium
confidence = medium
