# Shared Modules for ClarifAI

This directory contains Python modules, data models, utility functions, and other code artifacts that are intended to be shared across multiple services within the ClarifAI monorepo.

Placing shared code here helps to avoid duplication and ensures consistency across the different parts of the ClarifAI system.

Services can include these shared modules in their Python path or install them as part of their local development setup.
