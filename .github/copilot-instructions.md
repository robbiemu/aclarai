# GitHub Copilot - Project Guidelines and Instructions

This document provides details about the ClarifAI project, its structure, and the guidelines for implementing features and fixes. If you are asked to work on a something other than a sprint task, these guidelines may still be of interest. If you are asked to work on a sprint task, please follow the workflow outlined below.

## üéØ Objective

Your primary role is to act as an expert Python developer working on the ClarifAI project. When asked to process a sprint task document (formatted as `docs/project/epic_M/sprint_N-*.md`), you will analyze all relevant documentation, adhere to the project's coding standards and architecture, and produce a complete and correct implementation.

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure

This is a monorepo containing multiple services and shared libraries.

-   **`docs/`**: All project documentation, including architecture, design, and sprint plans. This is your primary source for requirements.
-   **`services/`**: Contains the individual applications.
    -   `clarifai-core/`: The main processing engine.
    -   `vault-watcher/`: File system monitoring service.
    -   `scheduler/`: For running periodic jobs.
    -   `clarifai-ui/`: The Gradio-based user interface.
-   **`shared/`**: Reusable Python modules, such as data models and common LlamaIndex tools, to be used across different services.
-   **`.github/workflows/`**: CI/CD pipeline configurations.
-   **`clarifai.config.yaml`**: The central configuration file for the entire application. All configurable parameters must be read from here.
-   **`.env`**: For storing secrets and environment-specific variables (e.g., API keys, database URLs).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Tooling

This project uses `uv` for package and virtual environment management.

-   **Setup:** `uv venv` to create the virtual environment.
-   **Install Dependencies:** `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
-   **Linting:** `ruff check .`
-   **Formatting:** `ruff format .`
-   **Testing:** `pytest`
-   **Pre-Commit CI Check:** Before any commit, run formatting and linting. The CI pipeline will enforce these checks.

## üêç Python & Project Guidelines

1.  **Type Hinting:** All new code **must** include full type hints using the `typing` module.
2.  **Structured Logging:** Adhere strictly to `docs/arch/idea-logging.md`. Logs must go to `stdout`/`stderr` and include `service`, `filename.function_name`, and relevant contextual IDs (`clarifai_id`, `job_id`).
3.  **Configuration Management:** **Never hardcode values.** All configurable parameters (model names, thresholds, file paths, cron schedules) must be read from the central `clarifai.config.yaml` file.
4.  **Error Handling & Resilience:** Follow the patterns in `docs/arch/on-error-handling-and-resilience.md`. Use retries with exponential backoff for transient network errors (APIs, DBs), implement atomic file writes (`write-temp -> rename`) for all vault modifications, and handle failures gracefully (e.g., returning `null` scores from evaluation agents).
5.  **LlamaIndex First:** Prefer LlamaIndex abstractions (`VectorStoreIndex`, `Neo4jGraphStore`, `ServiceContext`, agentic tools) for interacting with data stores and LLMs.
6.  **Reusable Code:** Place any logic, data model, or tool that could be used by more than one service in the `shared/` directory to avoid code duplication.
7. **Documentation and comments:** When adding new documentation or comments to code, never reference the documents in the doc/project/epic_M/ folders.

##  workflow:: Task Analysis & Implementation

When you receive a sprint task file, follow this precise workflow to plan and execute your work.

### 1. **Identify the Core Task**
-   Parse the filename to identify the **Sprint Number (N)** and the **Task Name**.
-   Read the "Descri√ß√£o" (Description) and "Escopo" (Scope) sections of the task document to understand the primary goal and boundaries of the work item.

### 2. **Establish Situational Awareness**
-   **Consult the Sprint Plan:** Open `docs/project/epic_1/sprint_plan.md`. Locate the entry for the current sprint and task to understand its context within the larger sprint goal.
-   **Consult High-Level Overviews:** Refer to `docs/project/product_definition.md` and `docs/project/technical_overview.md` to understand how this task contributes to the broader product features and technical architecture.

### 3. **Gather Architectural Context**
-   Systematically identify all relevant documents by meticulously scanning the sprint task for **explicit paths** and **implicit keywords**.
-   **Keywords to Documents Mapping:**
    -   "evaluation scores," "entailment," `decontextualization_score` ‚Üí `docs/arch/on-evaluation_agents.md`
    -   "configuration," "thresholds," "UI panel" ‚Üí `docs/arch/design_config_panel.md`
    -   "atomic writes," "file conflicts" ‚Üí `docs/arch/on-filehandle_conflicts.md`
    -   "Neo4j," "Cypher," "graph nodes" ‚Üí `docs/arch/on-neo4j_interaction.md`
    -   `clarifai:id`, `ver=`, "sync loop" ‚Üí `docs/arch/on-graph_vault_synchronization.md`
    -   "Top Concepts," "Subject Summaries," agent-written files ‚Üí `docs/arch/on-writing_vault_documents.md`
    -   "concepts," "vector store," `hnswlib` ‚Üí `docs/arch/on-concepts.md` & `docs/arch/on-vector_stores.md`
-   **Internalize these requirements** to ensure your implementation is consistent with the established architecture before writing any code.

### 4. **Handle Dependencies & Blockers**
-   **Identify Sibling Tasks:** Scan the file list for all other tasks in the same sprint (`sprint_N-*.md`).
-   **Analyze Prerequisites:** Read their descriptions. Determine if any must be completed *before* the current task can be fully implemented. (e.g., "Apply evaluation thresholds" depends on the agents that *produce* the scores).
-   **Formulate Action Plan:**
    -   **If NO blockers are found:** Proceed with a full implementation plan.
    -   **If a blocker IS found:**
        -   Clearly state which task(s) are blockers.
        -   Implement **only the unblocked, independent parts** of the current task.
        -   Prepare a pull request message using this template:
            ```markdown
            ### Completed Work
            - Implemented [describe the unblocked part of the task].
            - [List any other independent work completed].

            ---

            ### ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED
            **This PR is partial and a blocker is present.**

            - **Blocked by:** [List the full name(s) of the prerequisite task document(s), e.g., `sprint_7-Implement_entailment_evaluation.md`]
            - **Impact:** The core logic for [describe the blocked functionality] cannot be completed until the prerequisite task is done, as it depends on [describe the specific output/component from the other task].
