In this PR, please audit the code:
- what is not completed?
- check code quality -- good, easy to read pythonic code
- check comments and documentation added -- no references to anything in docs/project/ or the words "sprint 4" or sprint or epic.
- check for overreach -- no premature development that should be (better ) put off til later
- check test coverage - not in percentages but, are the functionality well tested?
- consider the code in relation to the general development instructions in .github/copilot-instructions.md and our recent discussion about a change I will be adding to that document. Does the code agree with the patterns and architecture we are embracing?
