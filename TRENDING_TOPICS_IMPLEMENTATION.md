# Trending Topics Job Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

The Trending Topics Job has been successfully implemented according to the requirements in `docs/project/epic_1/sprint_9-Implement_trending_topics_job.md`.

### üéØ Key Features Implemented

1. **Scheduled Job Integration**
   - Added trending topics job to the `aclarai-scheduler` service
   - Configurable cron scheduling (default: 5 AM daily)
   - Environment variable overrides for manual control

2. **Neo4j Edge Tracking**
   - Tracks `SUPPORTS_CONCEPT` and `MENTIONS_CONCEPT` edge creation timestamps
   - Uses `classified_at` property from existing claim-concept linking system
   - Efficient Cypher queries for temporal analysis

3. **Delta Calculation Logic**
   - Configurable time windows (default: 7 days)
   - Compares current period vs. previous period mentions
   - Calculates growth rates with special handling for new concepts
   - Respects `min_mentions` threshold to filter noise

4. **Top Concepts Selection**
   - Supports both `count` (fixed number) and `percent` (percentage) selection
   - Orders by growth rate with fallback to absolute mentions
   - Graceful handling when no concepts meet criteria

5. **Markdown File Generation**
   - Follows "Trending Concepts Agent" format from `on-writing_vault_documents.md`
   - Dynamic date in filename: `Trending Topics - {date}.md`
   - Proper `[[wikilink]]` formatting for concepts
   - Growth metrics display (percentage and absolute changes)
   - `aclarai:id` metadata for vault synchronization

6. **Atomic File Writing**
   - Implements `.tmp` ‚Üí `fsync` ‚Üí `rename` pattern
   - Safe for concurrent access with Obsidian and vault watchers
   - Follows `on-filehandle_conflicts.md` guidelines

### üîß Configuration Options

```yaml
scheduler:
  jobs:
    trending_topics:
      enabled: true
      manual_only: false
      cron: "0 5 * * *"  # 5 AM daily
      description: "Generate Trending Topics - <date>.md from concept mention deltas"
      window_days: 7      # Analysis time window
      count: null         # Fixed number of concepts (exclusive with percent)
      percent: 5          # Percentage of concepts to select (exclusive with count)
      min_mentions: 2     # Minimum mentions to be considered
      target_file: "Trending Topics - {date}.md"  # Output file with date placeholder
```

### üìä Sample Output

```markdown
## Trending This Week

*Analysis period: 2025-06-26 to 2025-07-03*

- [[Python Debugging]] ‚Äî Mentions up 88% (8 ‚Üí 15)
- [[Docker Containers]] ‚Äî New concept with 12 mentions
- [[API Development]] ‚Äî Mentions up 25% (20 ‚Üí 25)

### üß™ Testing Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:

- ‚úÖ Job initialization and configuration loading
- ‚úÖ Time window calculation logic
- ‚úÖ Concept selection algorithms (count vs. percent)
- ‚úÖ Markdown content generation with proper formatting
- ‚úÖ Dynamic file path generation with date substitution
- ‚úÖ Atomic file writing with temp file handling
- ‚úÖ Successful job execution with sample data
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of empty result sets
- ‚úÖ Error recovery when database queries fail

### üîÑ Integration Points

1. **Scheduler Service**: Fully integrated into existing APScheduler framework
2. **Neo4j Graph**: Uses existing claim-concept relationship data
3. **Configuration System**: Follows established configuration patterns
4. **Vault Synchronization**: Compatible with existing vault sync infrastructure
5. **Logging**: Structured logging following project standards

### üöÄ Usage

The job runs automatically based on the configured cron schedule. Users can:

1. **Configure the job** via `settings/aclarai.config.yaml`
2. **Monitor execution** through structured logs
3. **View results** in the generated `Trending Topics - <date>.md` files
4. **Enable/disable** via configuration or environment variables

### ‚ú® Key Benefits

- **Automated Discovery**: Automatically identifies trending concepts without manual curation
- **Data-Driven**: Based on actual mention patterns in the knowledge graph
- **Configurable**: Flexible parameters for different use cases and vault sizes
- **Resilient**: Graceful degradation and error recovery
- **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and metrics
- **Integration-Ready**: Seamlessly fits into existing aclarai ecosystem

The implementation fully satisfies all acceptance criteria from the sprint document and provides a robust, production-ready feature for tracking concept trends in the aclarai knowledge graph.
