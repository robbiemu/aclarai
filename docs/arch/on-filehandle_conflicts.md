Obsidian doesn’t place an exclusive lock on a Markdown file that’s open in an editor tab.
Its desktop app (an Electron/Node process) simply loads the file into memory and, on each save, writes the whole text back to disk with a normal `fs.writeFile` call. That default Node write mode keeps the handle open only long enough to finish the write and **allows other processes to open the file at the same time**. Users regularly edit the same note in VS Code or Vim while Obsidian is running; the last program to hit *Save* just wins, and Obsidian then notices the timestamp change and re‑indexes the note ([Obsidian Forum][1]).

Even making the file read‑only at the OS level doesn’t stop Obsidian from trying to save—it merely throws an error, which shows that the app never acquired an exclusive lock in the first place ([Obsidian Forum][2]).

### Practical implications for your sync strategy

| Concern                         | What actually happens                                                                                              | Design takeaway                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrent external edits**   | Possible; Obsidian’s watcher reloads the note after the fact.                                                      | Your graph‑sync service must treat *.md* files as mutable at any moment and reconcile on content, not assume exclusive access.                                                                                |
| **Partial writes / corruption** | Unlikely—`writeFile` is atomic on POSIX if it overwrites in place, but you still risk a torn write during crashes. | Use a *write‑temp → fsync → rename* pattern when your service modifies a note, so any other watcher (including Obsidian) either sees the old version or the fully written new one, never a half‑written file. |
| **Lock‑based coordination**     | Not available.                                                                                                     | Rely on ID + version counters in hidden comments or YAML front‑matter to detect stale graph copies, then apply optimistic‑locking rules in Neo4j.                                                             |

So you’re free to let ClarifAI edit vault files directly—just build conflict‑detection and atomic‑write safeguards into your sync layer rather than counting on Obsidian to hold a lock.
