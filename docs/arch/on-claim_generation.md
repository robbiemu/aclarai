Let's walk through an example of processing conversatino turns, clearly separating:

* Sentence ‚Üí
* Disambiguation (may still contain references) ‚Üí
* Decomposition ‚Üí only those outputs that pass Claimify's claim criteria

---

## üß™ Input Tier 1 Block (chat turn)

```text
in the else block I get:

O argumento do tipo "slice[None, None, None]" n√£o pode ser atribu√≠do ao par√¢metro "idx" do tipo "int" na fun√ß√£o "__setitem__"
"slice[None, None, None]" n√£o pode ser atribu√≠do a "int"
PylancereportArgumentType
```

Note: Claimify considers **previous and next raw sentences** during **Selection** and **Disambiguation**.

* These are raw (pre-decomposition), split from a sliding window of sentences across turn boundaries.

So for each sentence `s_i`, Claimify uses `[s_{i-p}, s_i, s_{i+f}]` as context during early stages.

## üì• Sentence-Level Chunks (post chunking, before Claimify)

1. `in the else block I get: O argumento do tipo "slice[None, None, None]" n√£o pode ser atribu√≠do ao par√¢metro "idx" do tipo "int" na fun√ß√£o "__setitem__"`
2. `"slice[None, None, None]" n√£o pode ser atribu√≠do a "int" PylancereportArgumentType`

---

## üîç Step 1: **Selection**

Both sentences are **passed** to the Selection stage. Assume Selection returns `"verifiable"` for both.

---

## üîß Step 2: **Disambiguation**

We now rewrite sentences to remove ambiguity and add inferred subjects, where possible.

### Sentence 1 ‚Üí Disambiguated:

> `[The user] received a type error from Pylance when executing the __setitem__ method with a slice argument.`

### Sentence 2 ‚Üí Disambiguated:

> `Pylance reported that a slice object cannot be assigned to an integer parameter.`

Note: These may still have compound structure ‚Äî that‚Äôs handled next.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Step 3: **Decomposition**

We now break these into standalone, atomic claims that meet the paper‚Äôs criteria:

### ‚úÖ Final `(:Claim)` nodes:

| Claim Text                                                                         | Passes Criteria? | Notes                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `[The user] received a type error from Pylance.`                                   | ‚úÖ Yes            | Verifiable, complete                       |
| `The error occurred while calling __setitem__ with a slice.`                       | ‚ùå No             | Ambiguous "the error" ‚Üí dropped            |
| `In Python, a slice cannot be assigned to a parameter of type int in __setitem__.` | ‚úÖ Yes            | Clean, static fact                         |
| `Pylance reported that a slice object cannot be assigned to an integer parameter.` | ‚úÖ Yes            | Self-contained + includes source (Pylance) |

---

### ‚úÖ Final set of stored `(:Claim)` nodes:

1. `[The user] received a type error from Pylance.`
2. `In Python, a slice cannot be assigned to a parameter of type int in __setitem__.`
3. `Pylance reported that a slice object cannot be assigned to an integer parameter.`

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Discarded Candidate:

* `The error occurred while calling __setitem__ with a slice.`
  ‚ùå **Not context-complete**

This becomes a :Sentence node.

| **Decomposition**  | Produces only self-contained, verifiable atomic claims                                              |
| **Graph**          | Only claims that survive decomposition become `(:Claim)` nodes; others result in `(:Sentence)` only |
