## üìñ Documentation Philosophy: Finding the Right Document

To help you find information efficiently, our documentation is organized into distinct categories. Understanding their purpose will help you locate the right document for your needs.

| Category | Purpose | Answers the Question... | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`docs/arch`** | **Why?** (Architectural Decisions) | "Why was it built this way?" | [`on-vector_stores.md`](./arch/on-vector_stores.md) explains the rationale for our vector database choices. |
| **`docs/components`**| **What?** (System Overviews) | "What does this system do?" | [`embedding_system.md`](./components/embedding_system.md) provides a high-level summary of the embedding pipeline. |
| **`docs/guides`** | **How does it work?** (Reference) | "What are my options for X?" | [`embedding_models_guide.md`](./guides/embedding_models_guide.md) is a reference for all supported embedding models. |
| **`docs/tutorials`**| **How do I do it?** (Instruction) | "How do I use X to achieve a goal?" | [`embedding_system_tutorial.md`](./tutorials/embedding_system_tutorial.md) is a step-by-step recipe for embedding a document. |
