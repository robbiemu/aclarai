## üìö ClarifAI Project Documentation: Your Compass

Welcome to the ClarifAI documentation hub! This file serves as your central point of orientation, guiding you through the various architectural decisions, technical specifications, and project plans that define ClarifAI.

Whether you're a new team member, a seasoned contributor, or just exploring the project, this guide will help you find the information you need quickly.

## üìñ Documentation Philosophy: Finding the Right Document

Many of our technical documents have been migrated to the [project wiki](https://github.com/robbiemu/aclarai/wiki). The wiki serves as our primary documentation repository following the completion of Epic 1.

Some documentation, particularly documentation of actually implemented structures in the codebase, are maintained in the codebase. Of note, this particularly includes some overlapping documentating in the `docs/arch` folder.

| Category | Purpose | Answers the Question... | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | **Why?** (Architectural Decisions) | "Why was it built this way?" | [On Vector Stores](https://github.com/robbiemu/aclarai/wiki/On-Vector-Stores) explains the rationale for our vector database choices. |
| **Components**| **What?** (System Overviews) | "What does this system do?" | Component overviews provide high-level summaries of major systems. |
| **Guides** | **How does it work?** (Reference) | "What are my options for X?" | Reference guides for supported configurations and options. |
| **Tutorials**| **How do I do it?** (Instruction) | "How do I use X to achieve a goal?" | Step-by-step recipes for common tasks. |
